## Introduction

Doc Detective provides a powerful feature to analyze the test coverage of your documentation. This helps ensure that your documentation is thoroughly tested and up-to-date.

## Steps to Perform Test Coverage Analysis

1. **Configure Your Environment**: 
   Ensure you have Doc Detective installed and properly set up in your project.

2. **Prepare Your Config File**: 
   Create or update your `config.json` file with the necessary settings for coverage analysis. Example:

   ```json
   {
     "runCoverage": {
       "recursive": true,
       "input": ".dev/",
       "output": ".",
       "markup": []
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run the Coverage Analysis**:
   Use the following command to run the coverage analysis:

   ```
   doc-detective runCoverage -c path/to/config.json -i path/to/docs -o path/to/output.json
   ```

4. **Interpret the Results**:
   The output JSON file will contain a summary of covered and uncovered elements in your documentation. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "summary": {
       "covered": 7,
       "uncovered": 0
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Review and Improve**:
   Based on the results, identify areas of your documentation that need more test coverage and update your tests accordingly.

## Best Practices

- Run coverage analysis regularly as part of your documentation workflow.
- Aim for high coverage, but remember that 100% coverage isn't always necessary or practical.
- Use the results to guide your testing efforts and improve documentation quality.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your documentation is well-tested and maintains high quality standards.
